library("ggplot2") 
#ggplot(data = mydata, aes(x = mydata$Congestion, y = mydata$X8AM.7PM.Parking.Occupancy, colour = "1"))
parking.occupancy = mydata$X8AM.7PM.Parking.Occupancy

parking.occupancy <- parking.occupancy[!is.na(parking.occupancy)]
print(parking.occupancy * 100)

ggplot(data = mydata) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mydata$Year, y = (mydata$X8AM.7PM.Parking.Occupancy * 100), color = mydata$Congestion)) + labs(title = "Relationship between Congestion and Parking Occupancy", x = "Year", y = "Parking Occupancy (%)", color = "Congestion")
